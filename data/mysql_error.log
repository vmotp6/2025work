InnoDB: ###### Diagnostic info printed to the standard error stream
2025-08-05 15:33:45 0 [ERROR] [FATAL] InnoDB: Semaphore wait has lasted > 600 seconds. We intentionally crash the server because it appears to be hung.
250805 15:33:45 [ERROR] mysqld got exception 0x80000003 ;
Sorry, we probably made a mistake, and this is a bug.

Your assistance in bug reporting will enable us to fix this for the next release.
To report this bug, see https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-bugs

We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

Server version: 10.4.32-MariaDB source revision: c4143f909528e3fab0677a28631d10389354c491
key_buffer_size=16777216
read_buffer_size=262144
max_used_connections=2
max_threads=65537
thread_count=7
It is possible that mysqld could use up to 
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_threads = 20304 K  bytes of memory
Hope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.

Thread pointer: 0x0
Attempting backtrace. You can use the following information to find out
where mysqld died. If you see no messages after this, something went
terribly wrong...
mysqld.exe!my_parameter_handler()
ucrtbase.dll!raise()
ucrtbase.dll!abort()
mysqld.exe!??$_Construct@$00PEBD@?$basic_string@DU?$char_traits@D@std@@V?$allocator@D@2@@std@@AEAAXQEBD_K@Z()
mysqld.exe!pthread_dummy()
KERNEL32.DLL!BaseThreadInitThunk()
ntdll.dll!RtlUserThreadStart()
The manual page at https://mariadb.com/kb/en/how-to-produce-a-full-stack-trace-for-mariadbd/ contains
information that should help you find out what is causing the crash.
